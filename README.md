# Welcome  

- 👋 Hi, I’m Shady Mohammed or in short --> @Smoha191
- 👀 I’m interested in applying my AI/ML knowledge on every aspect of life!  
- 🏆 I already applied AI/ML in Computer Networking, Medical Imaging, Satellite Imaging, Climate predictions & sometimes Stocks **(if the use case does NOT contradict with my faith)**
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Blockchain smart Contracts & Rienforcement Learning
- 🚧 All my work is set to be private since most of them are either done as paid service or on-hold due to patnet applications.
- 📫 How to reach me? shadyashraf68@gmail.com, smoha191@uottawa.ca (choose what you like!)
